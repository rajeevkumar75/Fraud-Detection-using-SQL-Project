# SQL-Data-Analysis-Fraud-Detection-Project
This project analyzes a financial dataset with over 1 million rows to detect fraud using SQL techniques, including CTEs. Key analyses include identifying suspicious accounts, tracing money laundering paths, computing moving sums of fraudulent transactions, verifying balance calculations, and finding transactions with zero balances.
