1) Advanced Fraud Detection Through the Use of Multiple CTEs:-
  Q.Use multiple CTEs to find accounts with suspecious activity, 
  like big money transfers, back-to-back transactions with no balance change, and flagged transactions.

2)Identifying Recurring Fraudulent Transactions:-
Q. Use a recursive CTE to trace possible money laundering paths where funds move between accounts over several steps, with each transaction marked as fraudulent.


3) Examining fraudulent transactions across time:-
Q.Write a Common Table Expression (CTE) to compute the moving 
sum of fraudulent transactions for each account, covering the last 5 time periods.

4) Q.create a query that verifies whether the computed value of new_updated_Balance matches the actual newbalanceDest in the table. If they are identical, the query should return those rows.

5)Q.Identify Transactions Involving Zero Balance:-
Objective: Identify transactions in which the destination account had a zero balance either prior to or following the transaction.
SQL Query: Construct a query to retrieve transactions where either oldbalanceDest or newbalanceDest equals zero.
